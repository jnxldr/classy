Checks a personal Google Sheets where I track my WoW Classic addons, and compares the latest upload date of an addon against the one in the sheet.

Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FF2AMBdi8GQSKecYbeGA_tQEB3XhH-QXG0xTegqvxks/edit?usp=sharing

TODO: 
* Automatically update the sheet with the latest upload date
* Offer to download the latest update (and then download it if desired)
